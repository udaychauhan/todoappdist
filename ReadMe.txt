Hi, this is Uday. The developer of this app.

First you have to make an account. There is facility to recover password in which an email is sent to the users email id.
One correction the email may contain address : localhost:4200/changepassword/*some code*. So instead of localhost:4200 use todoapp.udaychauhan.info. So eventually the address in your mail is to be seen as todoapp.udaychauhan.info/changepassword/*some code*

This app basically performs very basic todo list functions as listed below.

A user can  :
      1. Create and delete a Todo List.
      2. Create, delete, edit items of a Todo List.
      3. He can also undo changes that he had performed or were performed before on a list
      4. He can add friends and can perform steps 2 and 3 on his lists
      
Well that is not it.

A user can  make friends as we have mentioned above, also two users become friend only if the receiver of friend request accepts it,
Plus EVERYTHING HAPPENS IN REAL TIME and both of the users are updated.

A friend can make changes and undo changes on his friends list. And this also reflects and propogates in Real time.

Well try it out. Although the app is still in nascent stage but it will definitely live upto the expectations of them mentor and the students.
